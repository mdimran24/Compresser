main focus is compression and decompression.  The program should be able to input from the user and compress the list of positions (giving the same words the same positions) like in task 2. The main difference is that I will need to decompress the positions which means recreating the sentence from the positions. In addition to this I will include punctuation and capitalization using the compressed file. For this to be more practical I decided to make two separate programs to create this.
