This program is designed to analyse a sentence inputted by the User. The program will calculate the position of each character in the sentence. Program should not be case sensitive. The program should then label words with a number and duplicate words should have the same label. 
The program should be able to recreate the sentence using the positions.
Task 4 is then a sort of compression where it reuses these positions to recreate the sentence while using less data.
